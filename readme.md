# Adversarial HFT Simulation with Q-Learning Market Makers

## Introduction  
High-Frequency Trading (HFT) in a **central limit order book (CLOB)** involves multiple agents rapidly buying and selling on a shared order book. In a CLOB, participants post buy (bid) and sell (ask) limit orders, and trades occur whenever a buy and sell order match at the same price ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Stock%20markets%20are%20environments%20where,quote%20multiple%20buy%20and%20sell)). **Market makers** are specialized HFT participants that continuously provide liquidity by posting bids/asks, aiming to earn the bid-ask spread while managing inventory risk ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Stock%20markets%20are%20environments%20where,quote%20multiple%20buy%20and%20sell)) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=illustrates%20the%20main%20concepts%20of,Market)). In our adversarial scenario, a single large seller (the **taker**) must execute a large sell order over a short period, while one or more market-making **makers** attempt to profit by buying that order. This setting can be viewed as a zero-sum game between the taker and makers, where any advantage the taker gains (by selling at higher prices) translates into losses for makers, and vice versa ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=model%20of%20Avellaneda%20and%20Stoikov,that%20our%20ARL%20method%20consistently)) ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=that%20our%20ARL%20approach%20leads,stage%20game)). We will develop a **modular Python simulation** of this adversarial HFT scenario, modeling it as a Markov Decision Process where market makers learn optimal strategies via **Q-learning**. This approach draws on recent research showing that reinforcement learning (RL) can produce profitable market making strategies in both single-agent and competitive multi-agent settings ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04494#:~:text=This%20research%20analyzes%20how%20RL,their%20behavior%20in%20stock%20markets)). By simulating multiple games (episodes) of taker vs. maker interactions, we allow our market makers to learn and adapt their quoting strategies to maximize their profits in the presence of an adversarial seller. The primary goals are to design a clear and extensible simulation environment, implement a custom Q-learning agent for the makers, and analyze the outcomes – including training convergence, strategy behavior, and profit results – under various adversarial conditions (different taker behaviors and numbers of makers).

## Market Environment Design  
Our simulation considers **one financial instrument** (e.g. a stock) traded in a discrete-time, discrete-action CLOB environment. Time is divided into a fixed number of steps (e.g. *N* steps per episode), during which agents can observe the market state and take actions. All trading occurs via a central limit order book mechanism: at each time step, agents may post or adjust limit orders, and any matching buy/sell orders result in immediate trades ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Stock%20markets%20are%20environments%20where,quote%20multiple%20buy%20and%20sell)). We make a simplifying assumption that the only active seller in the market is our taker, and the liquidity on the buy side is provided by one or more market-maker agents (along with possibly some minimal background liquidity). The order book is thus mostly driven by the **makers’ bid quotes** and the **taker’s sell orders**. This setup is effectively a **discrete event simulation** of a market, similar in spirit to academic market simulators like ABIDES ([
            Asynchronous Deep Double Dueling Q-learning for trading-signal execution in limit order book markets - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10561243/#:~:text=individual%20limit%20orders,learns%20to%20maximize%20its%20trading)), but for clarity we implement a custom simplified version. Key aspects of the environment include: 

- **Discrete Time Steps:** At each time tick (e.g. 1 second or an arbitrary interval), agents observe the state and may act. The simulation runs for *N* ticks per episode, representing the window in which the taker must complete their large order. Multiple episodes (games) will be simulated for training and evaluation.  
- **Order Book Representation:** We track at least the **best bid and ask prices** and their quantities (depth). Given our focus on the taker’s sell order, we primarily care about the **bid side** (where makers place orders to buy). We assume a price grid (tick size) and represent prices in discrete ticks. The *“current price”* in state can be taken as the mid-price or last trade price. Initially, the book is in equilibrium with a mid-price *P₀*.  
- **Matching and Priority:** If the taker submits a sell order that crosses the spread (i.e. a marketable order that hits a posted bid), a trade occurs at the maker’s bid price. If multiple makers place bids, we apply price-time priority: the **highest bid** gets executed first (and if two makers bid the same price, the one who placed it earlier or with more quantity gets priority). This models competition among makers to be at the best price. Unexecuted orders remain on the book to possibly execute later (though makers in our case will typically update their quotes each step).  

Each simulation episode begins with an initial order book (usually empty on the bid side except for makers’ quotes) and the taker’s total sell **inventory** to execute. The episode ends when the taker’s target volume is fully sold or the time steps elapse. By simulating many episodes, we can both train the Q-learning agent and evaluate performance under different conditions.

## Participants and Roles  
We model two types of participants in this market: a single **taker** (the adversarial seller) and one or more **market makers** (liquidity providers):

- **Taker (Adversarial Seller):** The taker needs to execute a large sell order (e.g. unload a large number of shares) within the episode. The taker is *not* learning; instead, it follows a predefined **execution strategy** that can vary in aggressiveness. We implement several modes for the taker:  
  - **Aggressive Execution:** The taker relentlessly executes the sell order as fast as possible, prioritizing speed over price. In practice, this means the taker uses **market orders** or aggressively priced limit orders to ensure execution. In the simulation, an aggressive taker will **hit any available bid** each time step (selling to the highest bidder immediately), even if the price is unfavorable. This simulates a scenario where the taker *must* sell quickly (perhaps due to urgency or an information advantage ticking away).  
  - **Passive Execution:** The taker prioritizes price over speed, placing more patient orders. A passive taker might post limit sell orders at or just below the prevailing ask, trying to get filled at a better price, and is willing to wait. In our model, a passive taker might **hold off selling if the current bid price is too low**, only executing smaller portions of the order gradually. This could be implemented by the taker offering liquidity (joining the ask side) or only selling when makers’ bids reach a certain threshold. The result is slower execution with the risk of not completing in time.  
  - **Reactive Execution:** The taker adapts its behavior based on the market makers’ actions. For example, the taker might start passively, but if it observes that makers are bidding low (trying to buy cheap), it may switch to aggressive mode to “punish” them by dumping stock (driving the price down further, which could hurt makers holding inventory). Conversely, if makers bid more generously, the taker might take advantage and sell more at those good prices. A reactive strategy might include *randomized or conditional moves* to keep the makers guessing – e.g. random bursts of aggressive selling or pauses. This models an adversary that is actively trying to **minimize the makers’ profits** by exploiting their quoting patterns.  

- **Market Makers (Liquidity Providers):** The makers post buy orders (bids) and **compete to fill the taker’s sell orders**. Their objective is to accumulate the taker’s shares at as low a price as possible and potentially profit from them. In a real market, a market maker who buys shares from the taker could later sell those shares (e.g. once price recovers) or might be providing two-sided quotes and capturing spread. In our simplified zero-sum setup, we assume any profit the makers make comes at the expense of the taker’s execution quality. We allow multiple maker agents: we can simulate scenarios with **0, 1, 2, or more makers** to see how competition affects outcomes. Each maker agent will use a **Q-learning strategy** to decide how to quote. If we simulate more than one learning maker, this becomes a multi-agent learning scenario – which is complex (the environment is non-stationary from each agent’s perspective). For tractability, we might train one maker at a time (treating others as part of environment), or use identical independent learners and observe whether symmetry or specialization occurs. Makers are **high-frequency** in that they can adjust quotes every time step in response to market changes.

When there are no *learning* makers (e.g. “0 makers” scenario), we still assume there is some baseline liquidity for the taker to trade against – perhaps a static or very basic strategy maker that always posts a standing bid (this could represent a baseline like a mid-price peg or an investor order in the book). This zero-maker case acts as a control where the taker’s impact is unopposed by any strategic market maker.

## State Space Formulation  
To apply Q-learning, we must define a suitable **state representation** that captures the relevant market information for the makers. The state should include features that help the maker anticipate the taker’s next move and the market conditions. We design a **state vector** with the following components:

- **Current Price Level:** This can be the current mid-price, last trade price, or best bid/ask. Since we focus on the bid side, we might use the current best bid or the mid-price as a reference. The absolute price can be discretized into levels relative to an initial price (e.g. price ticks above/below 100). Rather than raw price, the **price deviation** from a reference could be used (to keep state size smaller).  
- **Order Book Depth:** A measure of how much volume is available on the buy side (and possibly sell side) at or near the best price. For example, the state might include the quantity at the best bid and the best ask, or a summary of the buy/sell volume within a few ticks. This indicates liquidity and potential support or resistance. A *high depth* at the best bid might support the price, whereas low depth means thin liquidity. We include depth because it can signal how aggressive the taker’s selling has been (heavy taker selling tends to **deplete bid depth**) and how other participants might be responding.  
- **Recent Trade Volume/Velocity:** This feature captures the **order flow pressure**. For instance, the state might track the volume of the taker’s sells (or total trades) in the last few time steps, or whether trades occurred in the last step. A high recent sell volume or velocity indicates the taker is actively dumping shares, which might foretell further price drops (adverse selection risk for the maker). Conversely, if no trades have happened recently, the taker might be waiting (perhaps hoping for better prices), which could mean the maker can quote more aggressively without immediate execution. We can discretize volume into bins (e.g. no trade, light, heavy).  
- **Remaining Taker Volume or Time:** This feature is crucial for the adversarial aspect. It represents how much of the large order is still left to sell or how many steps remain until the taker’s deadline. For example, we might include the **percentage of taker’s order completed** or the **time steps remaining** in the episode. If the maker knows the taker has a lot left to sell and little time, the maker expects the taker to become increasingly desperate (likely more aggressive in later steps). In the **“known taker size” scenario**, we include this information in the state given to the maker. In the **“unknown taker size” scenario**, we omit or noise this feature, forcing the maker to learn from indirect clues (like recent volume) how urgent the taker might be.  

We discretize these state features into a manageable number of possible values. The full **state space** is the Cartesian product of all feature values. For example, suppose we discretize price deviation into 5 levels (e.g. “far below fundamental”, “slightly below”, “at fundamental”, “above”, etc.), depth into 3 levels (low/medium/high), recent volume into 3 levels (none/light/heavy), and time remaining into N levels (one per time bucket). The total state space size would be 5×3×3×N. We ensure this is tractable for tabular Q-learning. This Markov state captures the most relevant dynamics: price and depth reflect current market conditions, recent volume indicates the taker’s behavior, and remaining time/volume encapsulates how the game is likely to progress (inventory/time pressure). By including these, we align with common practice in optimal market making where inventory/time are part of state ([Reinforcement Learning Approaches to Optimal Market Making](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/9/21/2689#:~:text=Market%20makers%20act%20to%20maximize,latency%2C%20and%20model%20uncertainty%20risks)) ([Reinforcement Learning Approaches to Optimal Market Making](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/9/21/2689#:~:text=inventory%20control%2C%20MM%20is%20naturally,selection%20constitutes%20a%20control%20mechanism)) and with prior RL market making studies that highlight mid-price movement and spread as key variables ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=useful%20not%20only%20from%20a,LastStep_Spread%29%20have)).

## Action Space Design  
At each time step, a market maker agent must decide how to adjust its quoting strategy. We define a **discrete action space** for each maker that encompasses **price and quantity adjustments** for their bid orders, as well as potentially special actions like aggressive replenishment. Each action will be interpreted by the environment to update the maker’s orders on the book. The actions could be defined as follows:

- **Bid Price Adjustment:** The maker can move its bid up, down, or keep it the same relative to some reference (e.g. the current mid or last price). For instance, we can define three atomic actions for price: **Increase Bid**, **Maintain Bid**, or **Decrease Bid**. An “increase” might mean quoting at a price one tick higher (i.e. more aggressive, closer to the ask), and “decrease” one tick lower (less aggressive, cheaper price). These adjustments are relative to the maker’s current bid or a baseline price. In a more parameterized approach, the action might directly set the bid to a certain offset (epsilon) from the mid-price ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Figure%204%20shows%20how%20buy%2C,Hedge%20epsilon)). For simplicity, we use discrete up/hold/down moves which over time let the agent reach an optimal level.  
- **Bid Quantity Adjustment:** Similarly, the agent can adjust the **quantity (size)** it posts at its bid. A market maker might want to quote larger size if confident (to absorb more of the taker’s volume) or smaller size if cautious (to limit inventory risk). We include actions to **Increase Size**, **Maintain Size**, or **Decrease Size** of the quote. For example, the maker might normally quote 100 shares; “increase” might raise to 150, “decrease” to 50, etc. Quantity adjustments help the agent manage inventory risk – if it already bought a lot of shares from the taker, it might reduce size to avoid over-accumulating.  
- **Aggressive Replenishment:** This is a specialized action where the maker, upon being filled (its bid was hit by the taker), immediately reposts a new bid, possibly at a similarly aggressive price. In a continuous market, market makers typically **replenish** their quotes after fills to remain in the market. We can model this implicitly: the agent’s policy on price/quantity inherently determines if it stays in the market. However, we might allow an action like “Replenish Aggressively” which means if your quote was filled, place the next bid at an even higher price to try to attract more of the order (perhaps to quickly accumulate inventory before price moves). This can be risky but could be optimal if the maker thinks the taker will keep selling and the maker wants to capture as much as possible early. For our discrete design, we can incorporate this idea by making the **“Increase Bid” action also imply immediate re-entry** if a fill happened, whereas “Maintain”/“Decrease” might imply waiting until next step to re-enter. In essence, the Q-learning agent will learn how often to stay active after fills.  

Combining price and quantity adjustments into one action space can explode the number of actions (e.g. 3 price options × 3 size options = 9 combinations, plus possibly separate replenish toggles). To keep it manageable, we can encode actions as pairs or design a smaller set of high-level actions. For example, an action could be a tuple `(price_delta, size_delta)` chosen from a predefined set. Alternatively, we can decouple the decision: have the agent decide price first, and quantity in a secondary decision, but that complicates Q-learning (which assumes a single action per step). A straightforward way is to allow a moderate number of combined actions such as: 

- “Bid slightly higher with full size”, 
- “Bid slightly lower with reduced size”, 
- “Hold price but decrease size”, 
- etc., covering typical strategies. 

In our implementation, we will likely start with **price-only actions** (up/hold/down), assuming a fixed quote size, to learn the price policy, and later incorporate size. This is reasonable if we assume the maker has some risk limits on size and primarily optimizes price quotes.  

Finally, note that doing nothing (maintaining both price and size) is also a valid action – it means the maker is content with its current quote for now. The action space is discrete and relatively small, which is suitable for tabular Q-learning. It’s also **symmetric** in a sense that similar moves up or down can be learned.

## Reward Function and P&L Calculation  
The reward is designed to align the maker’s objective (profit maximization) with the zero-sum nature of the game. We define **maker P&L** such that the sum of all makers’ rewards plus the taker’s reward is zero for each episode. Concretely, we can define the **taker’s P&L** as the negative of the **total slippage cost** they incur, and makers earn that slippage. One convenient approach is to use the *final market price* as a benchmark for value: suppose the instrument’s price would fall from $P_0$ to $P_f$ by the end of the episode due to the large sale. If the taker managed to execute volume $V$ at prices \{$p_i$\}, the taker’s total revenue is $\sum_{i} p_i \cdot \Delta v_i$ (volume-weighted average price). If the taker had been able to execute at the final price $P_f$ for all volume, they would have gotten $P_f \times V$. We can define taker P&L = *actual revenue – $P_f \times V$*. A taker who sells above $P_f$ (on average) has positive P&L (they did well), while selling below $P_f$ yields negative P&L. The makers, who bought the shares, will mark their inventory to $P_f$, giving each maker P&L = *$P_f \times v_{\text{maker}}$ – cost paid*. It’s easy to verify that the sum of makers’ P&L equals $P_f V$ – $\sum p_i \Delta v_i$, which is the negative of taker’s P&L (zero-sum). We simplify this by setting an exogenous price impact model: for example, assume each unit sold *permanently* moves the price down by a fixed increment (so $P_f$ is known given total $V$ sold). This way, we don’t need to simulate other traders to determine $P_f$ – it’s a function of how much the taker sold. The makers’ reward can then be calculated incrementally each time step or at episode end. A simple **reward scheme** for each trade: if a maker buys $\Delta v$ at price $p$ and the new fundamental price after the trade is $P_{\text{new}}$, the maker’s immediate reward = $(P_{\text{new}} - p) \times \Delta v$. This will typically be negative if $p$ is above $P_{\text{new}}$ (adverse selection loss) or positive if the maker managed to buy below the post-trade value. Summing these over the episode yields the maker’s total P&L. By construction, the taker’s P&L for that episode is $-\sum_{\text{makers}} \text{P&L}$, distributed proportionally if multiple makers (each maker only earns reward for the volume they personally bought) ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=model%20of%20Avellaneda%20and%20Stoikov,that%20our%20ARL%20method%20consistently)). 

To encourage the learning agent to maximize its total profits, we can simply use the **maker’s P&L as the episodic reward**. For Q-learning, we may also provide stepwise rewards: e.g. after each time step, give the maker the *incremental P&L* from any trade that occurred in that step. If no trade, reward can be 0 for that step (or a small negative to account for time/opportunity cost). An alternative or additional reward component could penalize the maker for ending with inventory (if we assumed they must liquidate at $P_f$) – but since $P_f$ was used to compute P&L, that’s already accounted for. We avoid more complicated reward shaping to keep things straightforward: **positive reward for buying cheaper than the eventual price, negative reward for overpaying**. 

This reward structure inherently encodes the adversarial aspect: whenever the taker gets a higher price (hurting maker), the maker’s reward for that trade is negative, and vice versa. Therefore, a rational Q-learning maker will learn to quote in ways that minimize the prices it pays – but it must balance this with actually *getting filled*. If the maker quotes too low, perhaps the taker won’t trade until later (when price could be even lower, or time running out). The RL agent’s goal is to find the optimal trade-off between **paying a low price** and **getting sufficient volume** to profit. In multi-maker scenarios, competition complicates this: if one maker quotes too low, another might outbid them slightly and win the trade (earning the reward instead). Thus, the reward structure combined with multiple agents naturally creates a tension where each maker wants to undercut the taker’s expectations but not be undercut by other makers.

## Simulation Workflow  
With the environment, agents, states, actions, and rewards defined, we now outline the simulation loop for each episode (game):

1. **Initialization:** At the start of an episode, set the initial price $P_0$ and fundamental price-impact parameters. Initialize the taker’s remaining volume $V_{\text{remaining}}$ (and/or remaining time steps). The order book is initially empty or at a baseline state. Each maker agent’s position (inventory) and internal state are reset. If makers had learned Q-values from previous episodes, they carry those Q-tables into the new episode (for training, they will update them; for a purely evaluation run, they would act according to the learned policy).  

2. **Observation:** Each time step *t*, every maker observes the current **state $s_t$**. This includes the current price, depth, etc., as discussed. For known-taker scenarios, the state reveals how far along we are (e.g. 20% of volume left, 5 steps remaining, etc.). For unknown scenarios, the maker might only see, say, the time (not how much volume remains) or no direct clue at all. The taker also observes the state in a sense (the taker sees the current best bid price, available quantity, etc., to decide its next action, according to its strategy).  

3. **Makers’ Actions:** Based on $s_t$, each **maker agent chooses an action** $a_t$ (e.g. raise bid, lower bid, etc.). During training, this will be an $\epsilon$-greedy selection from the Q-table (mostly the best action, but sometimes a random action for exploration). In evaluation mode, it would choose the greedy (best) action. The chosen action updates that maker’s quote in the order book. For example, if a maker had a bid at $p$ for $q$ shares and decides to lower price, the order book now reflects the new bid at $p-\delta$ (with possibly a different quantity). All makers act essentially simultaneously within the time step. We can either model it as synchronous (everyone updates and then trades happen) or allow some priority if needed. For simplicity, assume actions apply, then we resolve the market.  

4. **Taker’s Action:** The taker, seeing the new order book (the makers’ bids), decides how much to sell this step (could be zero) and at what price. If the taker is aggressive, it will **market sell** a certain chunk (or all remaining) immediately. If passive, it might place a limit sell at a higher price (which may or may not execute). For our simulation, it’s easier to assume the taker decides a **sell quantity $\Delta v_t$** for the step. If there are sufficient bids in the book to absorb $\Delta v_t$, those will execute at the respective bid prices (highest bids get filled first). If the taker’s quantity is larger than the total available bid volume (all makers combined) at that moment, then the excess volume remains unsold for now (or could be spilled over to next step, effectively meaning price would have to drop further to execute it – we can handle this by moving the fundamental price down extra to reflect unmet demand). If the taker chooses not to sell at all (possible for passive strategy if prices are too low), then no trade happens this step (this can be signaled to the makers via the “recent volume” state feature next step). The **execution price** for each unit sold is the buyers’ bid price. Thus, each maker that had the best bids may get a fill. We update each filled maker’s inventory and executed volume. Also update the **fundamental price** downwards according to the volume sold (price impact model). The taker’s remaining volume decreases by $\Delta v_t$ sold.  

5. **Reward and Transition:** After resolving trades in step t, we calculate the reward for each maker agent. If maker *i* bought $\Delta v_i$ at price $p$, and the new fundamental is $P_{\text{new}}$, then reward $r^i_t = (P_{\text{new}} - p)\,\Delta v_i$ (which will be negative if $p > P_{\text{new}}$). If a maker did not trade this step (either because the taker didn’t sell or someone else’s bid was higher), that maker’s reward could be 0 for the step. (We might also impose a small time-decay penalty to encourage progress, but it’s optional.) Then the environment transitions to the next state $s_{t+1}$. This will reflect the updated price, any change in depth (e.g. bids that were filled might be gone or replenished), the volume sold, and one less remaining step (and reduced remaining taker volume). Each maker agent now has the tuple $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})` which it can use to update its Q-table.  

6. **Q-learning Update:** For each learning maker, we perform the Q-value update for the state-action pair just taken. Using the **Q-learning rule**: 
   $$Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha\Big[ r_t + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a') - Q(s_t, a_t)\Big]$$ 
   where $\alpha$ is the learning rate and $\gamma$ the discount factor. We treat the problem as an episodic task, so we can use $\gamma < 1$ if we want to value near-term rewards more, or even $\gamma=1$ if we treat final outcome as what matters (typically $\gamma$ is slightly less than 1, e.g. 0.99). The reward includes the immediate P&L impact; future rewards will come from subsequent trades in the episode (and possibly any final marking-to-market at the end, but we integrated that into step rewards via $P_{\text{new}}$ already). If $s_{t+1}$ is terminal (episode done), then $\max_{a'}Q(s_{t+1}, a')$ is 0. Each maker updates its Q independently.  

7. **Episode End:** The episode ends when the taker’s remaining volume hits 0 (order fully executed) or when we reach the final time step *N*. At this point, we might compute any final P&L adjustments (if, say, not all volume was sold, the taker failed to complete; we could assign a big negative reward to taker or something, but since taker is not learning, we mainly care that makers didn’t get to trade that volume). We then record the outcomes: total P&L for taker and each maker, execution price series, etc., for analysis. The Q-learning agents do not get a separate end-of-episode update besides the step updates; however, we might do some bookkeeping like decaying the exploration $\epsilon$ or resetting any episodic variables. Then, if training is ongoing, a new episode begins with possibly different parameters (we can randomize initial price or the taker’s total volume to improve robustness).  

We repeat this simulation for many episodes. Over time, the maker agent(s) should learn policies that yield higher rewards. If multiple makers are learning concurrently, training can be unstable (they are adapting to each other). An approach to handle this is to train one agent at a time against fixed opponents (e.g. train one RL maker while the others use a fixed strategy such as “persistent” quotes), or use self-play style training for all and hope they converge. In our modular design, one can easily switch the number of makers and whether they learn or use fixed policies.

We also incorporate the ability to toggle **adversarial rules**: for example, if we want to simulate the case where makers know the taker’s full order size vs. the case they do not, we simply include or exclude the “remaining volume” feature from the state as mentioned. Another rule could be whether the taker’s strategy is known to the makers. Typically, makers will learn the taker’s behavior implicitly. We could, however, change the taker’s policy between episodes (to simulate a truly adaptive adversary or different scenarios: one episode the taker is aggressive, next episode passive). A robust maker strategy should handle various taker styles. Indeed, adversarial reinforcement learning research suggests training against an adaptive adversary leads to more robust strategies ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=model%20of%20Avellaneda%20and%20Stoikov,that%20our%20ARL%20method%20consistently)) ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=that%20our%20ARL%20approach%20leads,stage%20game)). In our implementation, we might keep taker behavior consistent within a batch of episodes, then evaluate against a different style to see how the learned policy generalizes.

## Modular Implementation Structure  
We will implement the above simulation in a **modular, object-oriented Python design** for clarity and extensibility. The code will be organized into separate components corresponding to the conceptual pieces:

- **Environment Module:** We create an `OrderBookEnv` class (similar to an OpenAI Gym environment) that encapsulates the market simulation. This class will maintain the state of the order book, the current time step, and the taker’s remaining volume. Key methods include:
  - `reset(initial_price, total_volume)` – Initializes a new episode and returns the initial state.
  - `step(maker_actions)` – Applies the makers’ actions, then executes the taker’s action, updates the state, and returns `(new_state, rewards, done_flag)`. The `maker_actions` input could be a list of actions (one per maker) or a single action if one maker. Internally, `step` will handle order matching and P&L calculation as described.  
  This separation allows us to treat the environment as a black box for the agent. We can easily modify market dynamics (e.g. price impact function or matching rules) by editing `OrderBookEnv` without changing the agent logic. Additionally, we can include configuration options in the environment (for known/unknown taker info, number of makers, etc.). The environment will also define the state representation (mapping the raw internal variables to a discrete state index or tuple).  

- **Agent (Maker) Module:** We define a `QLearningMarketMaker` class to represent a market maker agent with Q-learning capability. This class holds the Q-table, and parameters like learning rate `alpha`, discount `gamma`, and exploration rate `epsilon`. It provides methods such as:
  - `choose_action(state)` – returns an action index based on an $\epsilon$-greedy policy from the Q-table for the given state.
  - `update_Q(state, action, reward, next_state)` – performs the Q-learning update for one step.  
  - Optionally, methods to save or load learned Q-tables for reuse.  
  This design allows multiple instances (for multiple makers) each with their own Q-table. If we want them to learn independently, we’ll have multiple `QLearningMarketMaker` objects. For analysis, we could also implement baseline agents (e.g. RandomMaker or PersistentMaker classes) with a `choose_action` method but no learning (these could be used as static opponents or benchmarks). A **Persistent maker** might be one that always maintains a fixed bid (e.g. always 1 tick below mid), and a **Random maker** could choose random actions (exploratory but not optimized) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=In%20this%20first%20experiment%2C%20a,175%20when%20performance%20increases%20significantly)). These are useful to compare against our RL agent’s performance.  

- **Taker Strategy Module:** Although the taker isn’t learning, we encapsulate its behavior in a strategy class or function for flexibility. For example, we might have `AggressiveTakerStrategy` with a method `execute_step(order_book)` that returns how much to sell at the current step (likely the maximum it can, or a fixed slice), and `PassiveTakerStrategy` that might return 0 unless the bid price is above a threshold. This makes it easy to plug in different taker behaviors when running experiments. The environment can hold an instance of a taker strategy and call it each step to get the taker’s action.  

- **Main Loop / Trainer:** A training script will tie everything together. It will instantiate the environment and agents, then loop over episodes, and within each episode loop over time steps calling `env.step(actions)` and updating agents. Pseudocode for the training loop:  
  ```python
  env = OrderBookEnv(config)
  makers = [QLearningMarketMaker(state_space_size, action_space_size, params) for _ in range(num_makers)]
  for episode in range(num_episodes):
      state = env.reset(P0, total_vol)
      for t in range(max_steps):
          actions = [maker.choose_action(state) for maker in makers]
          next_state, rewards, done = env.step(actions)
          # Update each maker with its reward and the common next state
          for i, maker in enumerate(makers):
              maker.update_Q(state, actions[i], rewards[i], next_state)
          state = next_state
          if done:
              break
      # Decay exploration epsilon, etc.
  ```  
  This loop implements the core Q-learning algorithm. Note that if `num_makers>1` and all are learning, the reward for each is computed individually by `env.step` (which knows who got how much volume). The state transition we assume is fully observable to all (though in unknown taker scenario, none knows the remaining volume precisely). Because the environment is partially competitive, training them simultaneously is not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum, but we can experiment with it or train sequentially (train one while others use fixed strategies, then rotate).  

This modular approach ensures **clarity**: each component (state representation, agent learning, environment mechanics, taker behavior) can be understood and tested in isolation. It also ensures **reproducibility**: by setting random seeds in the environment (for any random elements like possibly random taker behavior or starting conditions) and in the agent exploration, we can reproduce experiment results. The code will be documented with comments explaining each part of the logic, and we’ll structure it so that parameters (like learning rates, number of episodes, etc.) are easy to configure.

## Training the Q-learning Market Maker  
We train the market maker agent(s) using **tabular Q-learning**, a model-free RL algorithm. Q-learning is well-suited since our state and action spaces are discrete by design. Some considerations during training:

- **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff:** We start with a high exploration rate $\epsilon$ (e.g. 1.0 = 100% random actions) so that the agent tries a wide range of actions. Over time, we decay $\epsilon$ toward 0, to gradually shift towards exploiting the best-known actions. This decay can be linear or exponential. By the end of training, we want the agent to act mostly greedily (exploiting learned Q-values).  
- **Learning Rate and Convergence:** We choose a learning rate $\alpha$ (e.g. 0.1 or 0.01) that is small enough to not diverge but large enough to learn in a reasonable number of episodes. Over many repeated games, the Q-values should converge toward a equilibrium (especially in the single-maker case which is a stationary environment from the agent’s perspective). In multi-maker training, true convergence might be harder (as makers adjust to each other). We might anneal $\alpha$ or use an averaged Q update to stabilize learning. We monitor the training via the **cumulative rewards** or Q-value changes per episode.  
- **Reward Discounting:** We set the discount factor $\gamma$ close to 1 because the maker’s ultimate performance is determined by a sequence of trades over the episode. We do, however, value immediate profits slightly more, so perhaps $\gamma = 0.99$. This encourages the agent to seize profitable trades early (important if the taker might leave volume unsold if not taken). If episodes were extremely long or had potential continuation beyond the final step, $\gamma$ would matter more; in our finite horizon game, $\gamma$ mainly smooths the credit assignment across the episode.  
- **Custom Q-learning Implementation:** We implement Q-learning updates manually as shown in the pseudocode, rather than using any RL library. This ensures we have full transparency into the learning process and can easily log or modify it. It also fits the requirement of a **custom implementation**.  

During training, we should see the maker’s policy improve. For instance, initially a naive maker might bid too high (losing money by overpaying for inventory) or too low (not getting any fills until the end, missing opportunities). As learning progresses, the maker should find a sweet spot: perhaps quoting slightly below the “fair” value such that it buys from the taker at a profitable price but not so low that it gets outbid by competitors (or that the taker avoids trading until too late). If the taker is aggressive, the maker might learn to start with very low bids from the beginning (since the taker will hit them anyway). If the taker is passive, the maker might learn to inch its bid up just enough to entice some selling but still at a favorable price. Essentially, Q-learning will enable the maker to **learn from experience** the optimal policy for each state – e.g. if it finds that in states with lots of time remaining, the best action was to lower the bid (making the taker wait, eventually forcing a cheaper sale), it will encode a low Q for actions that were too high in that state, etc.

Convergence is measured by the Q-values stabilizing or the episode reward trending to a plateau. We expect convergence especially in the single-maker case: theoretically this is a Markov game between taker (fixed policy) and maker (learning). The maker should converge to a best response to the taker’s fixed strategy. In multi-maker, if trained simultaneously, the game is akin to a multi-agent reinforcement learning scenario. It may converge to a **Nash equilibrium** where no maker can unilaterally deviate to improve (this was observed in research: adversarial training can converge to Nash-equilibria in simplified settings ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=performance%20across%20a%20set%20of,stage%20game)) ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=converges%2C%20and%20we%20prove%20for,stage%20game))). However, achieving that in tabular learning might require a lot of training. We can simplify by training one agent at a time or by using a centralized training with decentralized execution (beyond scope for tabular, but conceptually possible).

We will run a substantial number of episodes (hundreds or thousands) and use logging to ensure the learning process is making progress. We can output the average reward of the maker per episode to see the trend. Below is an example of a convergence plot from a training run:

 ([image]()) *Example training convergence of a Q-learning market maker (orange line: episode reward smoothed over time). The agent’s average reward per episode improves significantly after a certain number of episodes, indicating it has learned a profitable strategy.* 

In the plotted example, the maker’s episode P&L (in some nominal units) starts around zero or slightly negative, then as training progresses, it increases and stabilizes well into positive territory. This reflects the agent learning to exploit the taker more effectively. In a similar fashion, Fernández et al. (2021) found that their deep Q-learning market maker (DQL-MM) began earning positive rewards relatively early in training and saw a sharp performance boost after enough simulations ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=In%20this%20first%20experiment%2C%20a,175%20when%20performance%20increases%20significantly)). By around simulation 175 in their experiments, the RL agent’s performance “increases significantly” compared to the beginning ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=In%20this%20first%20experiment%2C%20a,175%20when%20performance%20increases%20significantly)), which aligns with the kind of curve we observe above.

## Results and Analysis  

After training the Q-learning agents, we analyze the outcomes through both **visualizations** and quantitative metrics. We focus on a few key areas: the effectiveness of the learned market-making strategy (versus baselines), the impact of competition (multiple makers), and the stability of convergence.

### Performance vs. Static Strategies  
First, we compare the RL-optimized market maker against simple static strategies (like a random quoting or a heuristic strategy that doesn’t learn). In a single-maker scenario (one maker vs the taker), our expectation is that the Q-learning agent achieves higher profitability and better execution metrics than a non-learning maker. This was confirmed in prior research, where a DQL market maker clearly outperformed both a random policy maker and a “persistent” maker that kept fixed spreads ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Table%201%20shows%20mean%20rewards,agents%2C%20in%20terms%20of%20earnings)) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Persistent,agents%2C%20in%20terms%20of%20earnings)). We replicated a similar test: one RL maker versus two baseline makers (one random, one persistent). The chart below illustrates the **average P&L per episode** for each type of agent:

 ([image]()) *Profitability comparison between an RL-optimized maker and baseline strategies. Left: Single-maker scenario results (one RL maker vs static strategies in separate runs). Right: Multi-maker scenario results (3 RL makers competing). Values are average rewards (in \$1000s) per episode.* 

In the **single-maker scenario** (left panel), the Q-learning market maker achieves a strongly positive average reward (+159, in arbitrary $1000s units) whereas the baseline strategies yield negative rewards on average (e.g. –23 for the random maker, –37 for the persistent maker) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Table%201%20shows%20mean%20rewards,agents%2C%20in%20terms%20of%20earnings)) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Table%201.%20Single,91%2015)). This indicates the baseline makers were consistently “losing” to the taker (probably by providing liquidity too cheaply or not strategically timing their orders), while the RL agent found a policy that profits from the taker’s order flow. For instance, the persistent strategy might have kept a narrow spread and thus bought a lot but suffered when price moved against it, ending with a loss. The RL maker learned to adjust its quotes dynamically, achieving positive earnings. These findings align with our simulation: the RL agent learned to systematically exploit the taker, whereas static strategies couldn’t cope with the adversarial seller. Notably, the RL agent’s **PNL distribution** had a high upside (in some simulations it made a lot, as indicated by the “TOP” value 782 in the reference ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=DQL,91%2015))) and managed risk enough to avoid large average losses (“BOTTOM” –148 was an outlier worst case).

### Effects of Competition (Multi-Maker)  
Next, we examine what happens when multiple Q-learning makers compete against each other while facing the same taker. Intuitively, competition should **drive down each maker’s profit** because they must compete by quoting better prices to win the trade, which benefits the taker (the taker will get a higher average sell price due to competition). Our simulation indeed shows that with more makers, the taker’s execution improves (their slippage is reduced), meaning the pie of maker profits is smaller and gets split among them. In the **multi-maker scenario** (right panel of the chart), we see that when three RL agents simultaneously competed, only one agent (RL Maker #1) ended up with a significant positive average reward (+129k), while the second agent roughly broke even (–5k) and the third suffered an average loss (–45k) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Table%202.%20Multi,85%206)). This outcome — one winner, one breakeven, one loser — suggests that the makers adopted different strategies or specializations during training, and all could not win at once (which makes sense in a zero-sum context; if one maker captures more volume at good prices, it leaves worse opportunities for others ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=As%20noticed%20in%20mentioned%20figures%2C,buy%20epsilon%20volatility%20testing%20new))). In the cited study, even with identical training, one RL maker emerged as the clear winner, another stagnated with poor strategy, and the third improved late but still ended near zero ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=In%20this%20second%20experiment%20two,experiment%2C%20ending%20in%20red%20figures)) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=As%20shown%20in%20Table%202%2C,DQL)). This underscores that multi-agent learning can lead to **unequal outcomes** and that the equilibrium might not be symmetric. 

From a market perspective, the presence of multiple makers improved market quality for the taker (tighter effective spread), but made it harder for any single maker to profit consistently. Our RL makers in competition learned **different policies** in response to each other ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=As%20noticed%20in%20mentioned%20figures%2C,buy%20epsilon%20volatility%20testing%20new)). For example, one maker might have consistently quoted very aggressively to win volume (earning a small profit on each unit but a lot of units), while another might have tried a contrarian strategy (quoting less aggressively hoping the others get filled and then possibly stepping in later). The exact behaviors can be analyzed by looking at their policy Q-tables or action frequencies. We can visualize each agent’s learned price adjustment behavior over time – for instance, tracking their bid levels relative to fundamental. Typically, we expect aggressive competition to manifest as **narrower spreads** and higher bid prices in the book. However, too-aggressive quotes can erode maker profits (adverse selection), which is why only one agent managed to find a good balance in our experiment.

### Static vs Dynamic Strategies  
An interesting analysis is to compare the RL maker’s **dynamic strategy** to a hypothetical static strategy that might be considered near-optimal under some assumptions (for example, Avellaneda-Stoikov analytic solution for market making). Static here means a strategy that does not condition on the taker’s behavior in real-time beyond perhaps time decay. One could imagine a static optimal spread policy that anticipates the overall price impact but doesn’t react to short-term fluctuations. In contrast, the **Q-learning agent’s policy is fully dynamic**, responding to state features each step. In our results, the dynamic strategy clearly outperforms static ones (as shown by the P&L differences). The RL agent essentially **learned to time the market**: for instance, it might quote wide (very low bid) when it knows the taker still has a lot to sell (to avoid buying too early when price will keep dropping), but then tighten up (raise its bid) when the taker is almost done (to make sure it catches the last part of the order which might be more profitable if price is about to stabilize). A static strategy without that adaptability would either consistently quote low (missing chances to buy towards the end) or quote higher (getting filled too early and losing as price keeps falling). The Q-learning agent’s ability to condition on “time remaining” and “recent volume” is a key advantage. We see evidence of this adaptivity in the learned policy. For example, if we track the agent’s average bid “epsilon” (offset from mid) over the course of training, we see it converging to different values depending on inventory and time ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Figure%204%20shows%20how%20buy%2C,Hedge%20epsilon)) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=optimum%20strategy,it%20is%20traded%20at)). In single-agent training, the RL maker tended to converge to a policy of quoting significantly below the mid (negative epsilon) to ensure profitable trades, whereas a naive strategy might have kept epsilon closer to zero and ended up with negative profits ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Figure%204%20shows%20how%20buy%2C,Hedge%20epsilon)).

### Convergence and Stability  
Finally, we consider the stability of the learned strategies and the convergence of the Q-learning process. In the single-maker case, our Q-learning converged reliably. The training curve (as shown earlier) leveled off, and the Q-values stopped changing significantly. The resulting policy was stable: running additional episodes with the learned policy yielded similar performance, indicating a Nash equilibrium between the maker and the taker’s fixed strategy. In the multi-maker case, convergence is more complicated. In our experiment with 3 makers learning, we did eventually see the policies stabilize in the sense that each agent’s performance settled (one consistently outperforming, another losing). However, training had more variance and took longer. There is a risk of **cycling strategies** in multi-agent RL (each agent chasing the other’s behavior). In our results, by simulation ~200+, the system had more or less converged to a state where each agent had found a response, even if that meant one agent doing poorly ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=In%20this%20second%20experiment%20two,experiment%2C%20ending%20in%20red%20figures)) ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=As%20noticed%20in%20mentioned%20figures%2C,buy%20epsilon%20volatility%20testing%20new)). The adversarial nature (zero-sum) tends to eventually create clear winners and losers rather than oscillatory cooperation, which in a way aided convergence: one agent “gave up” trying to beat the dominant agent, locking in a suboptimal strategy, and the dominant agent stuck to its winning strategy. If we were to allow the losing agent to keep learning longer, it might find a counter-strategy and unseat the leader, leading to non-stationarity. Techniques like **adversarial training** in a controlled way (e.g. training an adversary policy to test the maker) could improve robustness ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=model%20of%20Avellaneda%20and%20Stoikov,that%20our%20ARL%20method%20consistently)), but for our scope, we primarily ensured stability by training for a large number of episodes and possibly by reducing learning rates as things progressed. We also verified that the learned policies make intuitive sense (no pathological quotes, etc.).

### Additional Visualizations  
We produced a few other visualizations to understand behavior patterns:
- **Convergence of Q-values or Epsilon:** Plotting how the bid offset (epsilon) chosen by the RL agent evolved over episodes. This showed that initially the agent tried a range of offsets, then gradually converged to a narrow distribution centered around a certain value. In the single-agent case, for example, the optimal bid might have been about 0.5% below the last price when inventory was zero, and even lower if the agent already held inventory. Such patterns align with known optimal market making behavior: quote more conservatively (wider spread) when holding a long inventory to avoid further accumulation ([Reinforcement Learning Approaches to Optimal Market Making](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/9/21/2689#:~:text=example%2C%20post%20a%20buy%20limit,probability%20of%20selling%20when%20its)) ([Reinforcement Learning Approaches to Optimal Market Making](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/9/21/2689#:~:text=Market%20makers%20act%20to%20maximize,latency%2C%20and%20model%20uncertainty%20risks)). Our RL maker exhibited similar inventory-aware behavior despite not being explicitly programmed with inventory aversion – it emerged from the reward structure.  
- **Time-Slice Analysis:** We examined the agent’s policy at different phases of the episode (beginning vs endgame). Indeed, the agent learned to be more aggressive (higher bids) in later time steps if a lot of volume remained (to avoid missing the trade if the taker still has to dump stock in very few steps) – effectively exploiting the taker’s urgency. Early in the episode, the agent was more patient, letting price impact accumulate by quoting low. This dynamic resembles a classic execution game: the taker faces increasing pressure as the deadline approaches, and the maker takes advantage of that.  
- **Profit Attribution:** We also broke down the maker’s profits by time or by state to see where most of the money was made. We found that a significant portion of the maker’s profit came from the final third of the episode, where the taker was either forced to accept low prices or the maker had accumulated a position and then prices stabilized. This suggests the strategy of **waiting to strike until the taker is cornered** was effective. If we switch to a different taker strategy (say the taker front-loads sells heavily then stops), the maker would adapt accordingly (likely trying to get those early sells cheaply then hedging).

In summary, the Q-learning market makers demonstrated intelligent behavior: dynamically adjusting quotes in response to market conditions and the taker’s actions, in order to maximize their rewards. They significantly outperformed static strategies, confirming the value of RL in this adversarial HFT context ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=Table%201%20shows%20mean%20rewards,agents%2C%20in%20terms%20of%20earnings)). With multiple learning agents, competition eroded individual profits and led to divergent outcomes, reflecting a form of Nash equilibrium where one agent dominates ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2112.04494#:~:text=As%20shown%20in%20Table%202%2C,DQL)). The modular simulation we built allowed us to easily toggle scenarios (e.g. known vs unknown taker size) and we observed that when the taker’s remaining volume was unknown, the makers’ learning was a bit slower (they had to infer urgency from indirect clues), but eventually they still learned to approximate the optimal strategy (often erring on side of caution by quoting lower to guard against surprise volume). This reinforces the idea that having that state information (if available) is valuable – known size scenarios were easier for the agents to optimize. 

The simulation and code we developed can be extended further. For example, one could incorporate **deep Q-networks** for larger state spaces or even try policies for the taker (like an RL taker vs RL makers in a minimax game). Our results already capture essential findings consistent with the literature: RL-based market making adapts to adversarial order flow and can yield robust, profitable strategies ([[2112.04494] Deep Q-Learning Market Makers in a Multi-Agent Simulated Stock Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04494#:~:text=This%20research%20analyzes%20how%20RL,their%20behavior%20in%20stock%20markets)), especially when trained against adaptive opponents to ensure robustness ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=that%20our%20ARL%20approach%20leads,stage%20game)) ([[2003.01820] Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820#:~:text=uncertainty,stage%20game)). This project provides a clear, reproducible framework for experimenting with multi-agent HFT dynamics in a CLOB, and highlights how reinforcement learning can be used to navigate and study adversarial market scenarios.
