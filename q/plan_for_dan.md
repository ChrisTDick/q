# Launching a Crypto Options Market Making Desk: Key Plan Components

## Target Launch Date Options and Timeline 
A crypto options market-making desk typically requires careful sequencing of regulatory setup, technology development, and operational readiness. The business plan should outline **multiple timeline scenarios** to accommodate different strategies and risk appetites:

- **Aggressive Launch (3–6 months):** Suitable if leveraging existing infrastructure and operating in a friendly jurisdiction with minimal licensing. This fast-track timeline might involve using an off-the-shelf trading platform and focusing on one exchange initially. *Pros:* Rapid market entry and early revenue capture. *Cons:* Higher operational risk (less time for testing) and possible regulatory shortcuts. For example, using a white-label trading system can cut development to a few months ([How to Start a Crypto Exchange: 7 Easy Steps for Success](https://www.solulab.com/how-to-start-a-crypto-exchange/#:~:text=%24130%2C000%20to%20%24200%2C000,and%20scope%20of%20the%20project)), but may limit customization and scalability.

- **Standard Launch (6–9 months):** A balanced approach combining custom development with initial regulatory compliance. This timeline allows ~6 months for building or tailoring the trading engine, integrating with exchanges, and hiring key personnel, plus a few additional months buffer for testing and licensing. *Pros:* Sufficient time to develop a robust platform and comply with major requirements, reducing go-live risks. *Cons:* Medium time-to-market. (Notably, developing a new crypto exchange or platform from scratch often spans **6–9 months** ([How to Start a Crypto Exchange: 7 Easy Steps for Success](https://www.solulab.com/how-to-start-a-crypto-exchange/#:~:text=%24130%2C000%20to%20%24200%2C000,and%20scope%20of%20the%20project)), which is a reasonable benchmark for a proprietary desk’s tech build and setup.)

- **Extended Launch (9–12+ months):** A cautious timeline if significant **regulatory approvals** or a fully bespoke tech stack are needed. For instance, obtaining a U.S. derivatives trading license or a Singapore MAS license can take several months on its own. This scenario might involve a year of preparation: entity registration, licensing, custom low-latency system development, extensive simulation trading, and staged rollouts. *Pros:* Strong compliance footing and a battle-tested technology platform at launch. *Cons:* Higher upfront costs before revenue, and risk of missing market opportunities during the long prep phase.

Each timeline option should be tied to target launch dates (e.g. *“Aggressive plan: go live by Q4 2025”; “Standard plan: Q1 2026”*), with clear milestones. **Key milestones** might include entity incorporation, securing banking relationships, completing the core trading engine, connecting to target exchanges’ test environments, internal strategy backtesting, regulatory filings (if applicable), and a final go-live readiness review. The plan should emphasize that timeline selection depends on the founder’s strategic priorities – whether speed-to-market or thorough risk mitigation is the focus – and leave room to adjust timing as regulatory or technical uncertainties resolve.

## Technology Stack Recommendations 
Launching a market-making desk demands a **low-latency, resilient trading infrastructure**. The business plan should detail the proposed tech stack, including trade execution systems, connectivity, and data analytics, with rationale for each component. Key considerations include:

- **Core Trading Engine & Language:** For ultra-low latency and high throughput, **compiled languages** (C++ or Rust) or optimized Java (using frameworks like Chronicle) are recommended for the execution engine. These languages allow direct memory management and multithreading optimizations critical for real-time order placement. For example, Chronicle Software has applied HFT optimizations in Java to achieve low-latency crypto trading performance ([Low Latency Crypto Trading Systems with Java and Chronicle](https://foojay.io/today/low-latency-crypto-trading-systems-using-java-and-chronicle-services/#:~:text=However%2C%20when%20it%20comes%20to,from%20optimizing%20classic%20trading%20systems)). Rust is another strong choice: an open-source project *Botvana* demonstrates a high-performance trading platform in Rust, using a thread-per-core, lock-free architecture to minimize latency ([GitHub - featherenvy/botvana: Botvana is high-performance and event-driven trading system built using Rust (in early development).](https://github.com/featherenvy/botvana#:~:text=%2A%20High,tolerant%20features)). Such technologies enable reacting to market changes and placing orders ahead of the competition in an options order book. In contrast, scripting languages like Python, while great for strategy research, should be limited to analytics or prototyping due to higher latency.

- **Exchange Connectivity:** The stack must interface with multiple exchanges through APIs. Many crypto derivatives exchanges offer WebSocket or FIX endpoints for market data and order execution. **FIX protocol** is industry-standard for low-latency trading and may be available on regulated venues (CME, Bakkt), while WebSocket/REST APIs are common on crypto-native exchanges (e.g., Deribit’s JSON-RPC). The plan should note building or using robust **API connectors** for each target exchange, with auto-reconnect and failover. *Off-the-shelf vs custom:* There are libraries and SDKs (e.g., CCXT for Python, or exchange-provided client libraries) that can speed up connectivity to dozens of exchanges. Using these can accelerate development but might require customization for niche option products or exchange-specific features.

- **Infrastructure & Hosting:** **Low-latency infrastructure** is crucial. Co-locating servers physically near exchange matching engines can significantly reduce round-trip times. If the exchange offers co-location or cloud regions (e.g., AWS **region** nearest the exchange’s servers), the plan should include utilizing those. Many crypto venues run on cloud data centers; for example, a matching engine hosted in AWS *us-east-1* would favor trading servers in the same region. Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) can be used for flexibility and global deployment, but one must carefully design for consistent latency (e.g., using metal instances or AWS “elastic fiber” connectivity). Proprietary market makers often deploy a network of geographically distributed trading nodes to cover exchanges in the US, Europe, and Asia with minimal latency.

 ([GitHub - featherenvy/botvana: Botvana is high-performance and event-driven trading system built using Rust (in early development).](https://github.com/featherenvy/botvana)) *Illustrative high-level trading system architecture:* In this example, multiple “botnode” trading engines are deployed in different regions (e.g., Ohio and Tokyo clouds) close to local exchanges, all coordinated by a central server in another region (Frankfurt). This kind of distributed, event-driven setup helps minimize latency by placing execution engines near each exchange’s servers while maintaining a unified control center ([GitHub - featherenvy/botvana: Botvana is high-performance and event-driven trading system built using Rust (in early development).](https://github.com/featherenvy/botvana#:~:text=Botvana%20is%20an%20open,making%20and%20arbitrage%20strategies)) ([GitHub - featherenvy/botvana: Botvana is high-performance and event-driven trading system built using Rust (in early development).](https://github.com/featherenvy/botvana#:~:text=%2A%20High,tolerant%20features)). Green lines represent inter-bot communication (sharing price signals or risk data), and red lines represent communications with the central coordinator. Such an architecture ensures that orders on Exchange A, for instance, are handled by a regionally closest bot, reducing network hops – a critical advantage when making markets across global crypto exchanges.

- **Real-Time Analytics and Risk Management:** A market-making desk must monitor positions, P&L, and risk metrics (especially **options Greeks**) in real time. The tech stack should include a high-speed data pipeline: market data ingestion (possibly via Kafka or Chronicle Queue), in-memory computations for risk (Greeks calculation engines, perhaps using C++ libraries or GPU acceleration for option pricing), and a visualization layer (dashboards with real-time metrics). **Time-series databases** (like kdb+/q or InfluxDB) are commonly used in HFT for recording tick data and enabling quick historical analysis. The plan could propose using such a database for strategy analysis and parameter tuning. Additionally, alerting systems (using Grafana/Prometheus or custom scripts) should be in place to flag anomalies (like inventory limits reached or off-market pricing).

- **Off-the-Shelf Solutions vs. Custom-Built:** The plan should weigh buying an existing platform against building in-house. *Off-the-shelf* trading systems (or open-source projects like Hummingbot) offer a faster initial setup with basic order management, strategy templates, and exchange connectors ready ([How to Start a Crypto Exchange: 7 Easy Steps for Success](https://www.solulab.com/how-to-start-a-crypto-exchange/#:~:text=,Exchange%20Development%20Solution)) ([How to Start a Crypto Exchange: 7 Easy Steps for Success](https://www.solulab.com/how-to-start-a-crypto-exchange/#:~:text=,to%20start%20the%20business%20sooner)). This can be ideal for getting started or for less latency-sensitive operations. **Pros:** rapid deployment and lower upfront engineering cost ([How to Start a Crypto Exchange: 7 Easy Steps for Success](https://www.solulab.com/how-to-start-a-crypto-exchange/#:~:text=,to%20start%20the%20business%20sooner)); proven components (order books, order handlers) that have been tested. **Cons:** potential limitations in customization, performance ceilings, and dependency on third-party support ([How to Start a Crypto Exchange: 7 Easy Steps for Success](https://www.solulab.com/how-to-start-a-crypto-exchange/#:~:text=%2A%20Dependence%20on%20a%20third,the%20risk%20of%20security%20issues)). *Custom-built* systems, on the other hand, require more time and expert developers but can provide a competitive edge. Wintermute, for example, attributed its success to building a proprietary tech stack tailored for crypto market making, leveraging HFT best practices from traditional markets ([Wintermute Raises $2.8M Series A Funding Led by Lightspeed Venture Partners to Make Crypto Markets More Liquid and Efficient](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200707005270/en/Wintermute-Raises-%242.8M-Series-A-Funding-Led-by-Lightspeed-Venture-Partners-to-Make-Crypto-Markets-More-Liquid-and-Efficient#:~:text=Wintermute%20is%20a%20next%20generation%2C,making%20from%20traditional%20financial%20markets)). **Pros:** full control over features (custom pricing algorithms, hedging logic), optimized latency, and unique IP as a barrier to entry. **Cons:** longer time-to-market and higher development cost ([How to Start a Crypto Exchange: 7 Easy Steps for Success](https://www.solulab.com/how-to-start-a-crypto-exchange/#:~:text=,the%20complexity%20and%20resources%20required)). A **hybrid approach** could also be mentioned: start with an off-the-shelf or open-source core to enter the market quickly, then gradually replace or augment components with custom modules as the team grows. This provides a path to avoid “reinventing the wheel” early on, while ensuring the long-term platform is fully owned and tailored to the desk’s strategies.

In summary, the technology section of the plan should convey a **professional, high-performance trading architecture**. It’s wise to highlight that while upfront investment in a solid tech stack is substantial, it is a *strategic asset* for a market maker. The system’s speed and reliability directly influence profitability (tight spreads, quick quote updates) and risk control (preventing catastrophic losses from system lag or downtime). By providing clear justification for each tech choice (language, hosting, tools), the plan will instill confidence that the team can build and maintain an institutional-grade trading platform.

## Jurisdiction and Exchange Targeting 
Choosing the right jurisdiction for the business entity is a strategic decision that impacts regulatory compliance, the exchanges you can legally access, counterparty trust, and operational overhead. The business plan should compare the **benefits and constraints** of operating in different jurisdictions, specifically the U.S., Europe (EU/UK), Singapore, and an offshore location like Seychelles. It’s useful to present this comparison in a clear format, for example:

| **Jurisdiction**        | **Benefits**                                                                                            | **Regulatory Constraints & Risks**                                                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **United States** 🇺🇸    | *Market Credibility:* Operating under U.S. law can boost credibility with institutional clients and investors. <br>*Access to Regulated Markets:* Ability to trade on U.S.-based exchanges (CME Bitcoin futures/options, Bakkt, etc.) and serve U.S. institutions. <br>*Legal Protections:* Strong legal system for dispute resolution. | *Heavy Compliance:* Stringent oversight by SEC/CFTC for crypto derivatives; may require registering as a broker-dealer, FCM, or at least an MSB. Compliance costs (legal, reporting, audits) are hi ([Crypto exchange’s jurisdiction-shopping: a regulatory problem that requires a global response — Columbia Journal of Transnational Law](https://www.jtl.columbia.edu/bulletin-blog/crypto-exchanges-jurisdiction-shopping-a-regulatory-problem-that-requires-a-global-response#:~:text=questions%20regarding%20the%20jurisdiction,shopping%20actions%20are%20well))6】. <br>*Limited Offshore Exchange Access:* Many global crypto derivative exchanges (e.g., Deribit, Binance Intl) geo-restrict U.S. entities due to regulations, potentially narrowing the market universe. <br>*Licensing Time:* Setting up a regulated entity (e.g., getting a broker-dealer license or a FinCEN registration) can be time-consuming and costly. |
| **Europe (EU/UK)** 🇪🇺   | *Moderate Regulation:* More clarity emerging (e.g., EU’s MiCA framework) and generally fintech-friendly environments in countries like **Malta, Switzerland, or the  ([Best Jurisdictions for Starting a Crypto Business | Shift Markets](https://www.shiftmarkets.com/blog/best-jurisdictions-crypto-business#:~:text=,term%20success%20in%20the%20crypto))-L8】. Some EU jurisdictions (e.g., Malta) offer specific licenses for crypto services with reasonable approval timelines. <br>*Talent & Market Access:* London, Zurich, etc., have deep talent pools. Can legally engage with European institutional clients; EU passporting of services (under MiFID/MiCA) could simplify multi-country operations. | *Changing Rules:* The EU is strengthening AML/KYC and licensing (e.g., 5AMLD forced Deribit to relocate out of the Netherlands to Pa ([Deribit is moving to Panama as regulatory pressure mounts](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/deribit-is-moving-to-panama-as-regulatory-pressure-mounts#:~:text=Deribit%2C%20the%20popular%20Netherlands%20crypto,to%20avoid%20new%20AML%20regulations))-L8】). Compliance still significant – need to follow EU financial directives, conduct AML reporting, etc. <br>*Retail Derivatives Restrictions:* For instance, the UK bans crypto derivatives for retail users, which doesn’t directly stop a prop desk, but indicates a cautious stance. <br>*Tax and Reporting:* Varies by country – some have high corporate taxes or strict reporting (contrast Switzerland’s crypto-friendly tax regime with, say, Germany’s). Ensure the chosen country balances tax efficiency with compliance requirements. |
| **Singapore** 🇸🇬       | *Crypto Hub with Clear Rules:* Singapore (via MAS) offers licenses for Digital Payment Tokens and regulated trading, providing a clear legal path to operate. It’s seen as a global crypto finance hub, attracting many crypto funds and market makers. <br>*Access to Asia Markets:* Geographic advantage for serving APAC markets and connecting to Asian exchanges; overlapping time zones with major crypto trading hours. <br>*Business Environment:* Low taxes, stable political environment, and a strong financial infrastructure (banking, professional services). | *License Requirement:* Need to obtain a Capital Markets Services License or operate under exemptions for trading derivatives. MAS licensing can be rigorous – high standards for risk management, AML, and capitalization. <br>*Ongoing Compliance:* Regular audits, reporting to MAS, and adherence to strict AML/CFT laws (which are strictly enforced). <br>*No Lax Treatment:* While welcoming, Singapore will penalize non-compliance; the plan must account for building a compliance function locally. Also, certain global exchanges not licensed in Singapore might be off-limits unless only trading on behalf of the firm (proprietary trading is generally permitted, but offering services would need a license). |
| **Offshore (Seychelles)** 🏝️ | *Light Regulation & Speed:* Incorporation in Seychelles (or similar, e.g. BVI, Cayman) is fast and inexpensive. These jurisdictions have minimal licensing for proprietary trading – often no special crypto regulations yet, meaning the desk can start trading quickly. <br>*Broad Exchange Access:* Offshore entities are typically accepted by crypto exchanges that bar U.S. persons. This opens access to platforms like Binance International, Bybit, or OKX for crypto options/futures, and the ability to trade on **Deribit** (which bars U.S. but allows non-U.S. entities) – critical since Deribit is a top crypto options venue. <br>*Tax Advantages:* Often zero or very low corporate taxes and reporting requi ([Offshore Structures for Crypto Assets – Best Practices and Jurisdictions — Firm News & Legal Updates — January 24, 2022](https://www.hartdavidcarson.com/news/2022/january/offshore-structures-for-crypto-assets-best-pract/#:~:text=Tax%20Benefits)) ([Offshore Structures for Crypto Assets – Best Practices and Jurisdictions — Firm News & Legal Updates — January 24, 2022](https://www.hartdavidcarson.com/news/2022/january/offshore-structures-for-crypto-assets-best-pract/#:~:text=One%20advantage%20is%20a%20lower,the%20entity%20is%20set%20up))2-L100】. Profits can accumulate tax-free (though parent jurisdiction of founders may still tax personal gains). | *Credibility and Counterparty Risk:* An offshore address might raise questions for partners or VCs conducting due diligence, due to associations with lax oversight. Banking partners may be wary – converting crypto to fiat and holding it in a Seychelles corporate bank account can be challenging (banks prefer regulated jurisdictions). <br>*Legal Protection:* If an exchange defaults or a counterparty disputes a trade, legal recourse from an offshore entity is limited. Enforcement of contracts in Seychelles or BVI can be harder than in U.S./EU courts. <br>*Regulatory Risk:* There’s a risk of future crackdowns – e.g., U.S. regulators have indicted offshore exchange operators (BitMEX in Seychelles) for allowing U.S. customer a ([Crypto exchange’s jurisdiction-shopping: a regulatory problem that requires a global response — Columbia Journal of Transnational Law](https://www.jtl.columbia.edu/bulletin-blog/crypto-exchanges-jurisdiction-shopping-a-regulatory-problem-that-requires-a-global-response#:~:text=questions%20regarding%20the%20jurisdiction,shopping%20actions%20are%20well))71-L76】. While a pure prop trading desk doesn’t have customers, owners must ensure they personally don’t trigger jurisdictional issues (like U.S. persons running a Seychelles entity without proper legal firewalls). |

**Analysis:** The jurisdiction choice will influence which **exchanges** the desk targets for market making. For instance, if U.S.-based, the desk may be constrained to regulated venues (CME Group’s BTC and ETH options, LedgerX, etc.) and possibly **cash-settled options** on U.S.-compliant platforms. In contrast, a Singapore or offshore entity could freely make markets on **Deribit** (the leading crypto options exchange for BTC/ETH), as well as on Binance or OKX if those offer options or perpetuals. The plan should outline a strategy like: *“Incorporate in Malta to benefit from EU passporting, while using a separate BVI subsidiary to trade on offshore exchanges not available to EU clients.”* Such hybrid approaches are common – e.g., an EU HQ for credibility and an offshore trading arm for flexibility. 

It’s also important to address **regulatory changes**: crypto derivatives rules are evolving. Operating in multiple jurisdictions (via subsidiaries) might be wise for flexibility. Indeed, many market makers adopt a multi-entity structure – e.g., a Delaware C-corp for U.S. investors, and a Cayman or Singapore entity for global trading. The plan should demonstrate awareness of these nuances and possibly propose obtaining legal counsel in each considered jurisdiction to keep the operation compliant.

Finally, emphasize that **regulatory compliance is a priority** in whichever jurisdiction is chosen. According to a 2023 survey, 90% of crypto firms said the regulatory environment is the most important factor in choosing where to base ope ([Regulatory environment drives jurisdictional choice among crypto firms](https://www.aima.org/article/regulatory-environment-drives-jurisdictional-choice-among-crypto-firms.html#:~:text=,greatest%20interest%20as%20a%20jurisdiction))1-L189】. The business plan can state that the desk will *“choose a jurisdiction that offers a balance between innovation and compliance, to ensure long-term stability and access to markets.”* This assures investors that the decision will not solely chase lax regulation but consider longevity and reputation (for example, Singapore’s balanced approach may be favored over a pure offshore gamble).

## Team Composition and Organization 
A crypto options market-making desk requires a **cross-functional team** with expertise in quantitative trading, technology development, and compliance. The plan should outline the **key hires and team structure** needed to execute the business model, along with the ideal experience for each role. Below is a suggested team composition and org chart for the first 1-2 years:

- **Founder / CEO (Strategy Lead):** Likely the plan’s author, this person provides vision, oversees strategy, and manages investor relations. They should have a solid background in trading or crypto markets, as they’ll be coordinating between the trading and tech teams and making high-level decisions. (If the founder’s core skill is technical, they might take a CTO role and hire a business lead CEO, or vice versa.)

- **Chief Technical Officer (CTO) / Lead Quant Developer:** This is the technical captain who architects the trading platform. **Experience:** 5–10+ years in developing low-latency trading systems or complex fintech software. Ideally, they have prior **HFT or prop trading firm** experience and are fluent in performance-oriented languages (C++, Rust, or Java). Their role is to supervise all development, ensure the trading engine runs reliably under extreme market conditions, and implement algorithmic strategies in code. *For example, Wintermute’s founders were experienced engineers and traders who built a proprietary tech stack from  ([Wintermute Raises $2.8M Series A Funding Led by Lightspeed Venture Partners to Make Crypto Markets More Liquid and Efficient](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200707005270/en/Wintermute-Raises-%242.8M-Series-A-Funding-Led-by-Lightspeed-Venture-Partners-to-Make-Crypto-Markets-More-Liquid-and-Efficient#:~:text=Wintermute%20is%20a%20next%20generation%2C,making%20from%20traditional%20financial%20markets))61-L69】; similarly, our CTO will apply best practices from high-frequency trading to crypto options.* 

- **Quantitative Trader / Head of Trading:** This person (or team of two senior traders) will design and oversee the market-making strategies and risk management. **Experience:** 5+ years trading derivatives (ideally options market-making at a prop desk or bank), with deep knowledge of options Greeks, volatility surfaces, and arbitrage. They will set the quoting parameters (pricing models, edge, spread widths), manage the options portfolio (delta-hedging strategies, expiry management), and respond to market events. In a crypto context, they also need familiarity with the quirks of crypto markets (24/7 trading, higher volatility, exchange outages). This role works closely with the quant developers: e.g., specifying requirements for models or controls to be coded.

- **Quant Developers / Algorithmic Engineers:** A small team (2–4 developers) under the CTO focused on specific components: one might specialize in connectivity and data feed handling, another in the internal risk model and pricing algorithms, etc. **Experience:** 3–5 years in software engineering or data science, with strong programming skills. Some can be relatively junior but should ideally have exposure to financial engineering (e.g., implemented trading bots, or have a Master’s in Financial Engineering). They will implement and tweak trading algorithms, optimize performance (profiling the code for latency), and build analytic tools. **Real-time analytics developer:** One of the quant devs might focus on building the real-time dashboard and backtesting systems (knowledge of Python, data visualization, and time-series databases useful here).

- **DevOps and Infrastructure Engineer:** Especially if a custom stack is built, the plan should include at least one DevOps/SRE. **Experience:** 3+ years in devops or cloud engineering, familiar with low-latency networking (Linux kernel tuning, using VPCs, etc.). This role manages deployments, cloud instances or colo servers, automation of failovers, monitoring systems, and cybersecurity (firewalls, key management). For a small startup, this might be a part-time role or covered by the CTO initially, but it’s crucial as the operation scales to ensure **high uptime** and fast incident response.

- **Risk Manager / Compliance Officer:** Given the regulatory complexity, it’s recommended to have a dedicated person for compliance and risk, even if not from day one, then by the time of launch. **Experience:** 5+ years in financial compliance or risk management, ideally with certifications (CPA, CFA or FRM for risk; or CAMS for AML). This person ensures internal controls: they’ll set trading limits (position limits, drawdown limits), conduct regular P&L and exposure reports, and ensure the firm’s activities stay within legal boundaries. They will also establish KYC/AML policies for the firm (especially if the firm ever deals with counterparties or external capital). If bootstrapped and purely proprietary, compliance is simpler (mostly making sure exchange KYC accounts are in order and taxes are filed), so this role could be part-time via a consultant initially. However, if the desk takes on investors or operates in a regulated space, a full-time compliance officer is advisable to liaise with regulators and handle audits.

- **Chief Financial Officer (CFO) / Operations:** Handling finances (accounting, payroll, investor reporting) and general operations. In early stages, this could be combined with the CEO or an external accounting firm. But the plan can mention hiring a CFO or finance manager once funding grows (experience in fintech accounting, familiarity with crypto asset accounting treatments, etc.). This role manages the treasury (fiat and crypto holdings, ensuring there’s capital at exchanges as needed, managing collateral for margin on each exchange) and helps with fundraising logistics.

- **Additional Support Roles:** As the desk grows, roles like **Business Development** (to manage relationships with exchanges – securing market maker fee rebates, or with institutional clients if offering liquidity services), and **Legal Advisor** (perhaps outsourced) will become important. Initially, legal support can be via external counsel for setting up contracts and advising on jurisdictional matters. An **HR/admin** support might be needed once the team exceeds a dozen people.

The **organizational structure** in the plan could be depicted as: a core **Management team** (CEO, CTO, Head of Trading, CFO) overseeing their respective domains. Under CTO: the quant devs and devOps; under Head of Trading: junior traders or analysts (as the desk scales, you may add 1–2 junior traders to cover more hours or products); under CFO: perhaps an accountant or office manager later; and the Compliance officer working closely with both the CEO and CFO (or being a dual report). This structure keeps Tech and Trading interconnected at the top level, which is critical – successful market making firms blend technology with trading expertise  ([Wintermute Raises $2.8M Series A Funding Led by Lightspeed Venture Partners to Make Crypto Markets More Liquid and Efficient](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200707005270/en/Wintermute-Raises-%242.8M-Series-A-Funding-Led-by-Lightspeed-Venture-Partners-to-Make-Crypto-Markets-More-Liquid-and-Efficient#:~:text=Wintermute%20is%20a%20next%20generation%2C,making%20from%20traditional%20financial%20markets))61-L69】.

It’s useful to mention **experience levels and hiring plans**. For example:

- *“Hire two senior staff by Month 3 (a lead dev and a senior trader), then 3–5 additional hires by launch (developers and compliance). We seek quant developers with at least 3 years experience in low-latency systems, and traders who have run options books (equities or crypto) with notional portfolio sizes of $10M+.”* 

Also, note how the team might grow post-launch. Investors will want to know the team can scale with the business. Citing industry examples: Keyrock, a market maker founded in 2017, grew to over **100 employees** by 2022 as their business e ([Keyrock lands $72m in Series B funding round](https://www.fintechfutures.com/venture-capital-funding/keyrock-lands-72m-in-series-b-funding-round#:~:text=Keyrock%20is%20looking%20to%20expand,and%20Singapore%20in%20early%202023))3-L307】, doubling headcount even during a crypto bear market. Our plan might not aim for that size immediately, but it shows that as volume and complexity grow, the team could expand to include multiple strategy teams, regional offices (for 24/7 coverage), and robust operational support. Initially, however, a lean and expert team of ~5–10 people can successfully launch the desk. 

Lastly, emphasize a **culture of collaboration** between the quants and traders. The best market-making teams operate in unison: developers understand trading nuances and traders trust the platform. Highlight plans for cross-training (traders involved in system design discussions, developers present strategy backtest results, etc.). This will reassure stakeholders that the team won’t be siloed – a common reason trading startups fail is when tech and trading don’t communicate well. Given the technical finance audience, you can explicitly state: *“Our organizational structure is designed to foster tight feedback loops between strategy and engineering, similar to top firms like Jane Street or Optiver.”* This sets the expectation of a professional, high-performance team environment.

## Funding Strategy Options 
To launch and grow the desk, the business plan should outline funding needs and potential sources, providing a few strategic pathways. The goal is to show a **well-thought-out funding plan** including how much capital is required at seed stage versus later growth, and the trade-offs of different funding sources. Here are the main options to consider:

- **Bootstrapping / Proprietary Capital:** Using the founders’ own capital or early trading profits to fund operations. *Advantages:* Maximum control and ownership retention – the team isn’t answerable to external investors and can keep its strategies secret. Many traditional prop trading firms started this way (relying on trading profits to scale). Bootstrapping also signals confidence in the venture. *Disadvantages:* Growth is limited by personal capital and profits; it may take longer to scale up aggressively. Additionally, all risk is on the founders – a bad trading quarter could strain resources. This approach might suffice to build the MVP and even commence trading on a smaller scale (for instance, funding $1–2M as initial trading capital and to pay for a few salaries and infrastructure). The plan could mention *intent to bootstrap through the proof-of-concept phase*, then consider external funding for expansion. 

- **Venture Capital (Seed & Series A rounds):** Seeking VC investment can provide the firepower needed for rapid expansion (hiring top talent, deep liquidity for trading, global expansion). The plan should outline how much is needed in a **seed round** (pre-launch or immediately post-launch) and a **Series A** (once some traction is shown). *Market data:* Similar startups have raised seed rounds in the **$1–5 million** range and Series A in the **$5–20+ million** range, depending on market conditions and team pedigree. For example, London-based Wintermute raised **$2.8M in Series A**  ([Wintermute Raises $2.8M Series A Funding Led by Lightspeed Venture Partners to Make Crypto Markets More Liquid and Efficient](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200707005270/en/Wintermute-Raises-%242.8M-Series-A-Funding-Led-by-Lightspeed-Venture-Partners-to-Make-Crypto-Markets-More-Liquid-and-Efficient#:~:text=Wintermute%20is%20a%20next%20generation%2C,making%20from%20traditional%20financial%20markets))61-L69】 and subsequently a **$20M Series B in 2021** to expand into Asia and launch a derivatives b ([Lightspeed, Pantera Join $20M Raise for Crypto Market Maker Wintermute](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/01/20/lightspeed-pantera-join-20m-raise-for-crypto-market-maker-wintermute#:~:text=Lightspeed%2C%20Pantera%20Join%20%2420M%20Raise,for%20Crypto%20Market%20Maker%20Wintermute)) ([Lightspeed, Pantera Join $20M Raise for Crypto Market Maker Wintermute](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/01/20/lightspeed-pantera-join-20m-raise-for-crypto-market-maker-wintermute#:~:text=Announced%20Wednesday%2C%20Wintermute%20plans%20to,into%20Asia%2C%20the%20company%20said))1-L189】.

These figures indicate that venture investors are willing to pour significant capital once a market maker demonstrates a competitive edge and revenue growth. *Advantages of VC funding:* Large capital enables the desk to quote tighter spreads with bigger size (gaining market share), invest in superior tech and talent before profits are sufficient, and potentially capture network benefits (VCs often connect startups with partners or clients). Also, having reputable VCs can boost credibility (e.g., Lightspeed and Pantera backing Wintermute signaled confidence in it ([Lightspeed, Pantera Join $20M Raise for Crypto Market Maker Wintermute](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/01/20/lightspeed-pantera-join-20m-raise-for-crypto-market-maker-wintermute#:~:text=London,with%20participation%20from%20Pantera%20Capital))2-L170】). *Disadvantages:* Dilution of ownership and the need to meet investor expectations on growth. VCs typically look for scalability and eventual exit (M&A or IPO), which could push the firm towards taking higher risks or expanding services (like offering liquidity services to third parties) beyond pure proprietary trading. The plan should acknowledge this trade-off. It may propose a strategy like: *“Raise a $3M seed to reach launch, then a $10M Series A after achieving [specific milestone, e.g., $X daily trading volume or $Y in revenue],”* with an expected valuation range (seed valuations perhaps ~$10–15M pre-money, Series A $30–50M+, subject to traction).

- **Strategic Partners (Exchange or Industry Investors):** Another route is to partner with a crypto exchange or industry player for funding. This could mean an exchange (or its venture arm) takes an equity stake or provides credit in exchange for the firm making markets on their platform. *Examples:* Keyrock’s $72M Series B included participation from **Ripple** (a crypto company) and **SIX Group** (a traditional exchange op ([Keyrock lands $72m in Series B funding round](https://www.fintechfutures.com/venture-capital-funding/keyrock-lands-72m-in-series-b-funding-round#:~:text=Image%3A%20KeyRock%20logo))2-L290】, reflecting strategic alignment – Ripple benefits from more liquidity in its ecosystem, and SIX gets exposure to digital asset market infrastructure. An exchange like Binance or Coinbase might invest through their venture units if they see a market maker that could bolster liquidity on their exchanges. *Advantages:* Beyond capital, a strategic investor can offer preferential trading terms – e.g., higher API rate limits, lower fees or even negative fees (rebates) for market making, access to exclusive liquidity programs, or even seed liquidity (some exchanges offer market makers loans of assets to trade with). This can jump-start the desk’s volume and profitability. Also, the partner’s credibility can reassure other market participants. *Disadvantages:* There may be real or perceived conflicts of interest (the desk might be expected to favor that exchange or token project). It could limit the ability to make markets on competitor exchanges if not handled carefully. Also, if the strategic partner encounters trouble (consider if a market maker was heavily tied to FTX’s ecosystem, it would have suffered during FTX’s collapse), there’s contagion risk. The plan can mitigate this by stating any strategic partnership would be **non-exclusive** and aligned only insofar as it benefits the desk’s broad market reach.

- **Hybrid Approach:** The plan doesn’t have to pick just one funding model – it can sequence them. For example, **start bootstrapped**, prove the concept in 6 months, then raise a VC round for scaling. Or raise a small seed from an exchange incubator program (strategic money) to get started, and later do a larger VC-led round. Many crypto startups mix sources: maybe an angel round from industry experts (who can also advise) and then institutional VCs later.

In discussing funding, it’s important to include **typical use of funds** and **valuation rationale**. For instance: *“A $5M raise would predominantly go to trading capital (e.g., $3M as exchange collateral to support ~$30M in daily volumes assuming 10x leverage usage), with $1M for engineering salaries and $1M for operational runway.”* Breaking it down shows investors how their money fuels the business (market making is capital-intensive, so a significant portion often becomes trading capital on exchanges to facilitate large-volume market making). Also address runway – e.g., $5M covering 18 months of operations at planned burn rate, by which time the firm aims to be self-sufficient or ready for the next round. 

For valuation, anchor it to peers: if similar firms in the sector raised at certain valuations, mention those as reference points (without committing to a specific number, as that will depend on negotiations). Early-stage liquidity providers often command valuations of **5–10x their annualized revenues** if there’s strong growth potential, but since initial revenues may be modest, investor sentiment and team pedigree weigh heavily.

Finally, include contingency plans: if external funding is delayed or smaller than hoped, how will the business adjust? Perhaps a plan to scale down initial market breadth (fewer exchanges or option products) and focus on a niche until more capital is available. This shows prudence. On the flip side, if funding comes in larger, the plan could note how it would accelerate hiring or expand to additional markets (for example, add making markets on **DeFi options platforms** or expand the product range to futures and swaps).

In conclusion, the funding strategy section should reassure that the team is **financially savvy**. It should convey: *we have a clear idea of how much we need, why we need it, and what each source of funding brings to the table.* By providing options (bootstrapping vs VC vs strategic) with associated trade-offs, the plan remains **customizable** – the user can insert their preferred strategy or even a combination.
