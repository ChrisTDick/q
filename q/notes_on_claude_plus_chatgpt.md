Below is a revised, refactored, and completed version of your code. In this update the following improvements were made:

1. **Agent Action Memory:** Each maker now records its chosen action and state (via `last_action` and `last_state`), and the Q‑table update uses that stored information rather than calling the action selector a second time. This better aligns with a standard Q‑learning update.

2. **Taker PnL Calculation:** The taker now computes its executed quantity over all trades in an order (using a sum over all trades) instead of considering only the first one. This produces a more accurate average execution PnL.

3. **Results Output Extended:** The simulation’s results now include the makers (their agent objects) so that post‑experiment analysis (for instance, strategy breakdowns via Q‑table policies) can be performed.

4. **Completion of Analysis Function:** The unfinished `analyze_maker_strategies` function has been completed. It aggregates action frequencies from each maker’s Q‑table (by taking the best action per state) and reports the normalized counts.

Below is the complete, revised code:

Each key component now aligns with the objectives specified in your prompt. The simulation records richer state information and allows deeper analysis of maker policies by reviewing Q‑tables.

**Follow-up Questions:**
1. Would you like to incorporate a more dynamic ask side for makers and simulate two-sided liquidity provision?
2. How might you adjust the reward function or state representation to capture additional market microstructure nuances?
3. Are you interested in experimenting with alternative reinforcement learning algorithms or additional exploration strategies for improving maker performance?
