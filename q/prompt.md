### Prompt for Modeling HFT Market-Making Strategies in an Adversarial Setting Using Python and Q-Learning

You are tasked with modeling an adversarial simulation of a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) market-making environment using Python, focusing specifically on scenarios involving a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB). The goal is to optimize strategies for market-makers ("makers") interacting adversarially against liquidity-consuming participants ("takers").

#### Context:

- **Market Setting:**

  - A single market instrument with a CLOB environment.
  - Transactions are represented by discrete trades occurring at discrete timestamps.
  - The makers continuously provide bids and offers, while takers arrive randomly but execute predetermined large sell orders.
  - The game is structured into discrete time steps, up to a maximum of N steps, where N is configurable.
  - There can be multiple games, with varying rules. For example, in game 1 the size of the taker orders is known and fixed. In game 2, the taker orders have a size unknown to the maker.

- **Players:**

  - **Taker:** Initiates aggressive sell orders, for example, selling 8,000 contracts within a short period (e.g., 1 minute). Multiple predefined execution strategies for the taker include:

    - **Aggressive:** Selling rapidly and accepting significant market impact.
    - **Passive:** Selling incrementally to minimize immediate market impact.
    - **Reactive:** Adjusting selling intensity based on maker responses.

  - **Makers:** Competing market-making agents who provide liquidity by placing bids. Makers dynamically respond to takers' selling behaviors, aiming to maximize profits. Makers employ Q-learning to optimize their strategies, assuming inventory risks are hedged externally.

#### Simulation Requirements:

- **Objective:**

  - Model, test, and optimize maker strategies in response to varying taker behaviors.
  - Evaluate profitability and market share effectiveness.

- **Q-Learning Framework for Makers:**

  - **State Space:**

    - Current market price.
    - Current depth of order book (number of competing maker orders).
    - Recent trading volume and velocity.
    - Time remaining in the taker's execution window.

  - **Action Space (Discrete):**

    - Increase bid price by one tick.
    - Decrease bid price by one tick.
    - Maintain current bid price.
    - Increase bid quantity by a fixed increment.
    - Decrease bid quantity by a fixed increment.
    - Maintain current bid quantity.
    - Aggressively replenish bids at the current price.

  - **Reward Function:**

    - **Taker PnL:** Defined as the difference between the initial game price and the average execution price of their sell orders, with the objective of executing as close as possible to or better than the starting price.
    - **Maker PnL:** Defined as the negative share of the taker's PnL, proportionally divided among makers based on each maker's executed volume.
    - Implement the reward explicitly as maximizing the maker's share of this proportional PnL.

#### Experimental Design:

- Implement a Python simulation where:

  - A single "taker" executes predefined sell strategies.
  - Multiple competing "makers" simultaneously use Q-learning to discover optimal responses.
  - Explore scenarios varying the number of makers (0, 1, 2, and more).

- Assess and visualize outcomes such as:

  - Average profitability per maker strategy.
  - Impact of competition among makers.
  - Response patterns of takers to maker strategies.
  - Stability and convergence of maker Q-learning strategies.

#### Deliverables:

- Clearly structured Python code implementing the simulation, Q-learning model, and player behaviors.
- Results presented graphically to demonstrate:
  - Strategy effectiveness under various adversarial conditions.
  - Optimal policy convergence.
- Insightful analysis discussing:
  - Advantages and disadvantages of replenishing bids at fixed prices versus dynamically adjusting bids.
  - Impact of competition among multiple makers on strategy effectiveness and profitability.

**Note:** Ensure modularity in the Python code to facilitate testing various market conditions and participant behaviors. Provide clearly documented assumptions, parameter settings, and rationale behind model choices.
